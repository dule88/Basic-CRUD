//BASIC CRUD APPLICATION

NOT YET FINISHED, PRACTICING JavaSript, still some features need to be added.

ON WINDOW LOAD LIST CAN BE READ, ON BUTTON CLICK NEW PERSONS CAN BE ADDED AND ON DELETE BUTTON RECORD CAN BE DELETED.

// STILL TO BE FINISHED:
1. TO CHANGE A RECORD.
2. TO CREATE MODAL(BOOTSTRAP)
3. TO FIX RESPONSIVE. IT IS BREAKING(NOT LOOKING AS A GOOD UI PRACTICE), BELLOW 500px.
